About This Project: 🧮Student Result Checker

This is a  Python console application designed to help students quickly check their academic results based on marks entered for six subjects. It:

* Takes user input marks for 6 subjects (English, Python Language, C#, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry).
* Validates the input to ensure marks are between 0 and 100.
* Checks pass/fail status for each subject based on a passing criteria of 40 marks.
* Calculates total marks and overall percentage.
* Determines if the student has passed overall based on whether the overall percentage is 40% or more.
* Displays clear, user-friendly messages with emojis for motivation and encouragement.

### Why I built this project

As a student learning Python, I wanted to create a practical project that combines:

* Input validation
* Conditional logic
* Looping structures
* Calculations and formatting output
* User-friendly interaction in the console

This project helps me practice foundational Python skills and can be extended further with features like:

* Reading/writing results to files
* Generating report cards




THE DEMO OF PROJECT

🧮 Welcome to the Student Result Checker Program!
This program will take the marks of 6 subjects from you,
check your pass/fail status in each subject, calculate your overall percentage,
and tell you if you have passed overall.

Please enter your marks out of 100 for each subject.

Enter the marks for English: 86
Enter the marks for Python Language: 99
Enter the marks for C# Language: 56
Enter the marks for Mathematics: 78
Enter the marks for Physics: 42
Enter the marks for Chemistry: 29
========================================
Here are your results in each subject:
========================================
✅ You have passed in English with 86 marks.
✅ You have passed in Python Language with 99 marks.
✅ You have passed in C# Language with 56 marks.
✅ You have passed in Mathematics with 78 marks.
✅ You have passed in Physics with 42 marks.
❌ You have failed in Chemistry with 29 marks.
   Don't worry! You can try again and improve.
========================================
Overall Performance Summary:
========================================
🎯 Total Marks Obtained: 390 out of 600
📊 Percentage: 65.00%
🎉 Congratulations! You have passed overall based on percentage.
========================================
