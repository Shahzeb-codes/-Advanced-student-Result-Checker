About This Project: ðŸ§®Student Result Checker

This is a  Python console application designed to help students quickly check their academic results based on marks entered for six subjects. It:

* Takes user input marks for 6 subjects (English, Python Language, C#, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry).
* Validates the input to ensure marks are between 0 and 100.
* Checks pass/fail status for each subject based on a passing criteria of 40 marks.
* Calculates total marks and overall percentage.
* Determines if the student has passed overall based on whether the overall percentage is 40% or more.
* Displays clear, user-friendly messages with emojis for motivation and encouragement.

### Why I built this project

As a student learning Python, I wanted to create a practical project that combines:

* Input validation
* Conditional logic
* Looping structures
* Calculations and formatting output
* User-friendly interaction in the console

This project helps me practice foundational Python skills and can be extended further with features like:

* Reading/writing results to files
* Generating report cards
